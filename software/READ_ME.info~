These instructions explain how to install and run

the third test version of the XTDB upload software

xtdbread-v3.F90

Bo Sundman 2024.12.29

The instructions are for Microsoft Windows, an experienced Linux/Mac
user should be able to modify the appropriate parts.

1. Installation

A recent Fortran compiler is needed.  The compilation on Windows is

gfortran -o xtdbread -g -fcheck=all xtdbread-v3.F90

The gtp3_xml.F90 file is included in the xtdbread.F90 code.
It contains the XML tags and attributes and some global data.

The compiled program is xtdbread


2. Functionality

xtdbread asks for an xtdb file and extracts the elements from this.
The user can specify all or a subset of them to read from the xtdb file.

It is a debug version so quite a lot of information is written while
it is extracting data.  When it has finished it writes all data found
on the screen.  Please send me XTDB files which creates problems.

xtdbread can read an XTDB file and extract elements, species, phases, model
parameters, TPfun and bibliographic data from an XTDB file.

For use in a specific software one has to add routines to store this
data as required by the specific software.


3.  The XTDB files

All data can be on a single one, or split on several files specified
by the AppendXTDB tag.  3 cases are provided.

3.1 FeOU.XTDB with some data for the Fe-O-U system.

3.2 AlC.XTDB with data for the Al-C system

3.3 mpea5all.XTDB with data for the Al-C-Co-Cr-Fe-Mn-Ni-V system
collected by Bengt Hallstedt.

The last database is split into several files to test the AppendXTDB
feature.  In the master file the elements, species and all phases must
be entered but there can also be other XTDB tags.

3.3.1 The ModelAppendXTDB.XTDB specifying the thermodynamic models and
their Model Parameter IDentifiers (MPID).  This should be separate for
each software and simplify the use of a database with different
software.  This file is read at the start and can be used to adapt the
database to the specific software.

3.3.2 mpea5par.XTDB with most of the model parameters for the phases.
This is read once after the master file read and the parameters
for the selected elements and phases are extracted.

3.3.3 mpea5tp,XTDB should only contan TPfuns and nested Trange tags.
It will be read after the parameter file and maybe several times and a
TPfun may need another TPfun.

3.3.4 mpea5bib.XTDB should only contain bibligraphic information and
those bibitems referenced from the parameters will be extracted.


4. Applications

The program has two main subroutines, xtdbread which reads the whole
file and calls appropriate subroutines for checking and storing data
and xtdbtag which extracts a tag together with appropriate nested tags
from the file.  All the information selected by the user is stored
inside xtdbread and can be retrieved by appropriate routines from the
applications software.  The storage is not adoped for calculations,
that has to be provided by the application software.


5. XML compatibility

There is no specific check that the XTDB file conforms with all XML
specifications, there are sufficient software around to do that.  But
it will easier to share databases between different softwares when
they use the XTDB format.  It will also be easier to extend to other
types of data interesting in materials science.
