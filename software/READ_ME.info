These instructions explain how to install and run the first test
version of the XMLTDB upload software.

Bo Sundman 2023.03.21

The instructions are for Microsoft Windows, an experienced Linux/Mac
user should be able to modify the appropriate parts.

You need a C and Fortran compiler to install the software.  Please
give feedback on problems with the software.

The file "link-upload.txt" compiles and links the source code.
On Windows this should be renamed with extention .CMD and executed.
The source code is in the src/ directory.

After sucessful execution of the link-upload file there will be
an executable program "UPLOAD".

In the examples/ directory there is a test TDB file
"FeNi-fcc-magn.TDB" which has been used for testing.  Other TDB files
generated by Thermo-Calc or other software may also be used but may
generate errors.

The UPLOAD software has a file browser installed making it easy to
select input file.  It may need modifications on Linux/Mac.

The upload program will generate an output file "XMLTDB-file.XTD" with
the XML version of the TDB file.  There is a file
"XMLTDB-file-original.XTD" generated from the FeNi-fcc-magn.TDB.

The UPLOAD program will also be a file "fort.30" generated because
there are problems.  Please ignore this, there are still many problems
to solve handling the information on the TDB file.
