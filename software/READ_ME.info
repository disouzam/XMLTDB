version of the XMLTDB upload software.

Bo Sundman 2024.03.21

The instructions are for Microsoft Windows, an experienced Linux/Mac
user should be able to modify the appropriate parts.

You need a C and Fortran compiler to install the software.  Please
give feedback on problems with the software.

The file "link-upload" compiles and links the source code.
On Windows this should be renamed with extention .CMD and executed.
The source code is in the src/ directory.

After sucessful execution of the link-upload file there will be
an executable program "UPLOAD".

In the examples/ directory there is a several TDB files that can be
used for testing.  Other TDB files generated by Thermo-Calc or other
software may also be used but may generate errors.

The UPLOAD software has a file browser installed making it easy to
select input file.  It may need modifications on Linux/Mac.

The upload program will generate an output file "XMLTDB-file.XTD" with
the XML version of the TDB file.
