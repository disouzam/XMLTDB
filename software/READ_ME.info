These instructions explain how to install and run
the 4th test version of the XTDB upload software

xtdbread-v6.F90

Bo Sundman 2025.01.06

1. Installation

These instructions are for Microsoft Windows, an experienced Linux/Mac
user should be able to modify the appropriate parts.

A recent Fortran compiler is needed.  The compilation on Windows is

gfortran -o xtdbread -g -fcheck=all xtdbread-v6.F90

The gtp3_xml.F90 file is included in the xtdbread.F90 code.
It contains the XML tags and attributes and some global data.

The compiled program is xtdbread


2. Functionality

xtdbread asks for an xtdb file and extracts the elements from this.
The user must then specify all or a subset of them to read the data
from the xtdb file.

I have removed most debug information and unless there is an error the
user will only be presented with a listing of the elements, species,
phases, parameters, TPfuns and bibliographic references extracted.

There are some XTDB files generated by OC supplied.  Please test your
own XTDB files and send me problematic ones.

The data extracted from the XTDB file is stored in an internal data
structure in xtdbread.  For use in a specific software one has to add
routines to extract this data.  I am currently working on this with
OC.


3.  The XTDB files

The XTDB data can be on a single one, or split on several files
specified by the AppendXTDB tag.  3 cases are provided.

3.1 FeOU.XTDB with some data for the Fe-O-U system.

3.2 AlC.XTDB with data for the Al-C system and generation 3 models.

3.3 mpea5all.XTDB with data for the Al-C-Co-Cr-Fe-Mn-Ni-V system
collected by Bengt Hallstedt.

The last database is split into several files to test the AppendXTDB
feature.  In the masterfile the elements, species and all phases must
be entered but there can also be other XTDB tags.

3.3.1 The ModelAppendXTDB.XTDB specifying the thermodynamic models and
their Model Parameter IDentifiers (MPID).  This can be separate for
each software and the interest is to simplify the use of an XTDB
database with different software.  This file is read at the start and
can be used to adapt the database to the specific software, for
example the use of Model Parameter IDentifiers (MPID).

3.3.2 mpea5par.XTDB should contain most of the model parameters for
the phases.  This is read once after the master file has been read and
the parameters for the selected elements and phases are extracted.
The parameters are independent and depend only on the phase and the
constituents of the phase.  But they may depend of TPfuns.

3.3.3 mpea5tp,XTDB should only contain TPfuns and nested Trange tags.
It will be read after the parameter file and maybe rewinded several
times as a TPfun may depend on another TPfun.

3.3.4 mpea5bib.XTDB should only contain bibligraphic information and
the bibitems referenced from the parameters will be extracted.


4. Applications

The program has two main subroutines:

xtdbread which reads the whole file and calls appropriate subroutines
for checking and storing data and

xtdbtag which extracts a tag together with appropriate nested tags
from the file.

All the information for the elements selected by the user is stored by
xtdbread and can be retrieved by appropriate routines from the
applications software.  The storage in xtdbread is not adoped for
calculations, that must be provided by the application software.


5. XML compatibility

I need help to verify that the XTDB format conforms with the XML
standard.  There is no specific check in xtdbread that the files
conforms with all XML specifications, there are sufficient software
around to do that.  The hope is that we can easier share databases
between different softwares when they use the XTDB format and there is
a standard way to extend to new models and other types of data
interesting in materials science.


6. Feedback

I am totally dependent on you for feedback.  Please test the xtdbread
software and send me (and everyone) comments.
